![plot](./save/Ningguang_DustofMist_600.png)

This plot is the 2d-histogram of a simulation for the artifacts farming result with the following conditions:
Character : Ningguang  
Weapon : DualofMist  
Artifact Set : Archaic Petra 2, Gladiator's Finale 2  
Resonance : Geo  

This simulation is for artifact farming with only one artifact dungeon. Therefore the above Ningguang's result is not accuate.
